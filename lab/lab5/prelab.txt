Describe and compare roulette wheel (fitness proportional) and ranked selection mechanisms.

Fitness proportional:
Parents are selected with bias corresponding to their fitness. 

Rank selection:
All individuals are ranked according to their fitness and and are sorted
Then, selection is applied based on the rankings based on the relative
performance of the individuals. The absolute values of the fitness are
discarded.


Both are similar, but the difference is that with fitness proportional, the
percentage of the wheel allocated (or the likelihood of the individual to be
selected) is based on the fitness function, while with ranked selection, the
portion allocated on the wheel does not depend on the fitness function.


i.e. in ranked selection, the top ranking individual will always be allocated
the same percentage of the wheel, while with the roulette wheel method,
the highest ranking individual will still get the 'bigger piece of the pie' but
the actual amount depends on the individual's fitness function.
