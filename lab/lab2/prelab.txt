A decision matrix is a bunch of values in rows and columns. 
It allows for a list of options to be narrowed down to a single choice for problems in which multiple dimensions must be considered
This is useful in the context of control systems.
That is, we can have a list of options on the left side of the table, and the factors on the top

Weights are then assigned for each factor. These weights are fuzzy values which come from the fuzzy rule sets.
These elements can be found using the max-min composition of the related fuzzy relations.
Finally, to get the resulting decision, we can multiply each weight by each element value found using the max-min composition, 
sum up each row, and then pick the option with the highest sum to arrive at a decision.



        | x  y  z   | sum
--------------------------
Weights | #  #  #   |
--------------------------
Option 1|           | ##
Option 2|           | ##
Option 3|           | ##
--------------------------
